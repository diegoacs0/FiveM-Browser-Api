# Baiano's FiveM Rest API
A simple Fastify REST api to be used with FiveM for communication between browser and server protocols on build.

### Utils
+ REST handler for external use;
Readme before sending me something to merge:
* Preferably use json responses as default. (if possible)
* Try to make a freacking clean code.
* Pls create your own config file inside modules and do not use default ./config.json to your scripts. You are free to use ./modules as you want.
* Put all of your external responses at ./lang/lang-CODE.json for easier translations, or inside your config.
* Don't flood console out of debug mode.
